    <br>
     <p>After volunteering & traveling abroad, coding languages became an interest alongside a foundation in French & foreign language. </p>
     <p>A dream of mine is coding an intelligent application to program interface designed to communicate & personalize a linguistic programming tool, for both English & French translations.</p>
      <p> I've worked providing information to impoverished communities regarding their healthcare, human rights, and education programs, as well as working as well as volunteering as a language tutor & after school care provider.</p>
      <p> This past summer was spent cultivating lilies at a small business located in an island town on the Maine coastline, after working several years working in New York City as an reprographics specialist & tutor. </p>
      <p> In my free time I handmake reticella lace & have been learning to program my keyboard into a soundbox with a raspberryPi.</p>
